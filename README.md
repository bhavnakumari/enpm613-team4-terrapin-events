## Branching Strategy

To maintain a clean and stable development workflow, the project follows a two-tier branching model with main and develop as the primary branches.

main branch
- Represents the production-ready or final stable codebase.
- Contains thoroughly tested, reviewed, and approved features from completed sprints.
- Only release-quality code is merged into main.
- Protected against direct commits ‚Äî all updates must come from pull requests (PRs) merged from develop.
- Each merge into main is considered a sprint release (e.g., Sprint 1, Sprint 2, etc.).

develop branch
- Serves as the integration branch where features are merged after successful local development and testing.
- Always contains the latest working build that integrates multiple features or bug fixes.
- Acts as the staging area for upcoming sprint releases.
- Developers create feature branches from develop (e.g., feature/login-api, feature/event-registration-ui) and merge back into develop via pull requests once code is reviewed and verified.

## ‚ú® Features (MVP)
- CAS SSO + JWT RBAC (Admin, Organizer, Participant)
- Event creation & approval, ticket types & capacity
- Registration & **automated waitlist**
- Payments via gateway (e.g., Stripe) with webhooks
- Notifications (email) for confirmations & updates
- Calendar integration (Add-to-Calendar + iCal feed)
- Reporting exports (CSV)

## Architecture
```
frontend/  # React Vite client
backend/   # FastAPI service (REST & Swagger)
mongo      # MongoDB (Docker)
```
- Auth: UMD CAS ‚Üí FastAPI ‚Üí JWT cookie
- Payments: server-side intents; webhook endpoint `/webhooks/payments`
- Calendar: iCal feed + personal calendar buttons

## Getting Started (Local)

### Prerequisites
- Node 20+, Python 3.11+
- Docker & Docker Compose

### 1) Configure environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` with your keys (Mongo, CAS, Stripe, SMTP).

### 2) Run with Docker Compose
```bash
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up --build
```
- Frontend ‚Üí http://localhost:5173  
- API (Swagger) ‚Üí http://localhost:8000/docs  
- Mongo ‚Üí mongodb://localhost:27017

### 3) Run manually (alternative)
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Testing
```bash
# Backend
pytest -q

# Frontend
npm run test
```

---

## Security & Compliance
- FERPA-aware data handling; no card PAN stored (tokenization via provider)
- CAS + JWT; secure cookies, CORS, CSRF protection
- Keep secrets in env / GitHub Secrets; never commit `.env`

---

## Deploy (Akamai Connected Cloud)
- Build/push Docker images from CI
- Provision VM/container instance on Akamai (Linode)
- Pull images and run via compose or systemd
- CI/CD pipeline uses `AKAMAI_API_TOKEN` (placeholder) for automation

See `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `infra/docker-compose.yml`.
